# First Project - Don't leave the kids alone
This is a game project based on HTML5 and Javascript. It is part of my Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp.


## Installation
You will need juts to access https://tiny.cc/alisonbessa and **start having fun!**


## How to play
You must use the directional keys to control the mais char. <br>
Try to avoid the pink enemies that will fall randomly. <br>
Catch as many green kids as possible. <br>
**Atention:** It might look easy in the begining, but all the speeds will be increased as you score!
